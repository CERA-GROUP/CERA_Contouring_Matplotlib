# Matplotlib Contouring for ADCIRC NetCDF Data
==============================================

This script uses the python library matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/) 
to create and plot contours from a single ADCIRC netcdf file. If multiple 
time steps are given in the ADCIRC netcdf file, the first time step will 
be extracted.

## Description

The Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment (CERA) team provides guidance about
storm surge and waves for the Northern Gulf and the Atlantic Coast through 
its online portal (http://coastalemergency.org). In addition to that, we 
are working towards the goal of providing all layers in the shapefile 
format compatible with GIS software. This feature will be available for the 
hurricane season 2015.

We use the Python Matplotlib library (http://matplotlib.org/) to convert 
the ADCIRC NetCDF format into contours which can then be used to generate 
shapefiles. While working on the algorithms, the CERA team has discovered 
some specifics which are essential to produce clean geometries. Clean 
geometries in GIS terminology do not include any self-intersections, 
overlapping, or duplicate features and ensure the hassle-free usability for 
GIS specialists and emergency managers.

Here are the specifics and bug fixes that we have addressed:

1. Matplotlib 'tricontourf' expects a data array, but does not support 
   masked arrays. If you pass a masked array, it will be ignored. The 
   triangulation should only contain triangles with valid data at all 
   three vertices. The solution is to either remove invalid triangles 
   from your 'element' array before creating the triangulation, or set 
   a mask on the triangulation once it has been created. 

2. The created contours will contain one or more polygon exteriors and 
   zero or more interiors. They can be in any order (an exterior is not 
   necessarily followed by its interiors). This has to be explicitly 
   tested in your own script. The CERA code takes care of this issue.

## System Requirements

* Python 2.7.x
* numpy (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
* netCDF4-python and requiered dependencies 
  (https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python/blob/master/README.md)
* matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
* Shapely (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely)


## Usage

cera_contour_matplotlib.py -i (input datafile) -a (netcdf attribute name) 
-g (mesh file) -n (intervals) -m (maxlevel)

where: (mandatory)

       -i | infile	name of the NetCDF input file containing the 
                        ADCIRC data
       -a | attrname	attribute name of the NetCDF data array
       The option -g is only required if the ADCIRC mesh information is
       not included in the data input file.
       -g | grid	name of the NetCDF file containing the ADCIRC mesh
                        (default: input file)

       (optional)
       
       -n | intervals	number of contour intervals in output file 
                        (default:30)
       -m | maxlevel	maximum data value to be used for contouring 
                        (default:highest value in data array)

## Example usage
Download the test data file (maxele.63.nc) in your script directory.

1. cera_contour_matplotlib.py -i maxele.63.nc -a zeta_max
   
Note  example_1_plot.png
      In this example, no optional parameters (-n intervals or -m maxlevel) 
      are specified. The default values for these options will be applied.
      The maxlevel uses always the original units from the input file 
      (here: meters).  
      The output contours will be classified as 30 levels and stretched 
      between zero and and the maximum data value in the input file 
      (here: 10.62 meters).

2. cera_contour_matplotlib.py -i maxele.63.nc -a zeta_max -m 2

Note: example_2_plot.png
      In this example, the maxlevel is given with the option -m as 
      2 (meters).  
      The output contours will be classified as 30 levels (default value for
      the missing option -n (intervals). The levels will be limited to 0-2m. 

3. cera_contour_matplotlib.py -i maxele.63.nc -a zeta_max -n 10 -m 1

Note: example_3_plot.png
      In this example, the output contours will be classified as 10 levels 
      (option -n intervals) between 0-1m (option -m maxlevel).
